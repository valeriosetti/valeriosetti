I'm a passionate embedded developer mainly focusing microcontrollers based on RTOS and Linux (Kernel & Yocto).

Here's my open source contributions:

- [MbedTLS](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls) --> [My contributions](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Avaleriosetti+)
  - Improved support for elliptic curves (EC) acceleration through drivers
  - Improved suport for acceleration of EC based algorithms: ECDH, ECDSA, ECJPAKE
  - Currently working on acceleration for Ciphers and AEAD algorithms

- [Zephyr](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr) --> [My contributions](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Avaleriosetti+)
  - Minor fixes to the log system
  - Drivers' development

Here's my personal projects:

- https://github.com/valeriosetti/ergodash-low
  - It's an improvement of the already existing [ErgoDash](https://github.com/omkbd/ErgoDash) split keyboard in order to:
    - give it a lower profile
    - use Gatheron low-profile switches instead of the standard profiles ones

- https://github.com/valeriosetti/ploopy-nano-kicad
  - It's a remake of the famous [Ploopy Nano](https://github.com/ploopyco/nano-trackball) trackball mouse. Reasons for the remake is to provide schematic and PCB in KiCAD intead of Altium as the original project does.

- https://github.com/valeriosetti/dabon-fw
  - A portable (i.e. battery powered) radio and MP3 player based on STM32F407
  - It inregrates the Si4684 chip from SiLab in order to be able to receive both FM and DAB
  - It is based on a rather simple custom cooperative OS developed by me
