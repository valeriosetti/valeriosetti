🧑‍🦱 **Brief introduction**

I'm a passionate embedded developer mainly focusing microcontrollers based on RTOS and Linux (Kernel & Yocto) 💻 🐧 

I work [@BayLibre](https://baylibre.com/)

👯 **Open source contributions**

- [MbedTLS](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls)
  - [My contributions](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Avaleriosetti+)
  - Improved support for elliptic curves (EC) acceleration through drivers
  - Improved suport for acceleration of EC based algorithms: ECDH, ECDSA, ECJPAKE
  - Improved suport for acceleration for Ciphers and AEAD algorithms
  - PSASIM simulator for a crypto-client setup

- [Zephyr](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr)
  - [My contributions](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Avaleriosetti+)
  - Crypto (MbedTLS and TF-M) contributor
  - Drivers' development (encoders on STM32 devices)
  - Minor fixes to the log system
 
- [Trampoline RTOS](https://github.com/TrampolineRTOS/trampoline)
  - [My contributions](https://github.com/TrampolineRTOS/trampoline/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Avaleriosetti+)
  - ICCOM driver on Spider platform (both on G4MH and Cortex-R52)
  - Ethernet driver (Rswitch & SerDes) on Spider platform and [LwIP](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/lwip.git) integration for the provided examples

🏠 **Personal projects (relevant ones)**

- [ErgoDash-Low](https://github.com/valeriosetti/ergodash-low) ⌨️
  - It's an improvement of the already existing [ErgoDash](https://github.com/omkbd/ErgoDash) split keyboard in order to:
    - give it a lower profile
    - use Gatheron low-profile switches instead of the standard profiles ones

- [Ploopy-nano Kicad](https://github.com/valeriosetti/ploopy-nano-kicad) 🖱️
  - It's a remake of the famous [Ploopy Nano](https://github.com/ploopyco/nano-trackball) trackball mouse. Reasons for the remake is to provide schematic and PCB in KiCAD intead of Altium as the original project does.

- [DABon FW](https://github.com/valeriosetti/dabon-fw) 📻
  - A portable (i.e. battery powered) radio and MP3 player based on STM32F407
  - It inregrates the Si4684 chip from SiLab in order to be able to receive both FM and DAB
  - It is based on a rather simple custom cooperative OS developed by me
 
- [CarPlayer](https://github.com/valeriosetti/car-player) 🚙📻
  - A [buildroot](https://github.com/buildroot/buildroot) and [OrdoidC2](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-c2/) based car stero player
  - https://github.com/valeriosetti/linux-amlogic-v6.1 contains my changes to the [mainline Amlogic kernel](https://linux-meson.com/) in order to make it work for my project
 
👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on**

- Linux kernel, Yocto and Zephyr developments
