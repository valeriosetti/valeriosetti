🏠 **Personal projects**

- https://github.com/valeriosetti/ergodash-low ⌨️
  - It's an improvement of the already existing [ErgoDash](https://github.com/omkbd/ErgoDash) split keyboard in order to:
    - give it a lower profile
    - use Gatheron low-profile switches instead of the standard profiles ones

- https://github.com/valeriosetti/ploopy-nano-kicad 🖱️
  - It's a remake of the famous [Ploopy Nano](https://github.com/ploopyco/nano-trackball) trackball mouse. Reasons for the remake is to provide schematic and PCB in KiCAD intead of Altium as the original project does.

- https://github.com/valeriosetti/dabon-fw 📻
  - A portable (i.e. battery powered) radio and MP3 player based on STM32F407
  - It inregrates the Si4684 chip from SiLab in order to be able to receive both FM and DAB
  - It is based on a rather simple custom cooperative OS developed by me
 
- https://github.com/valeriosetti/car-stereo 🚙📻
  - A [buildroot](https://github.com/buildroot/buildroot) and [OrdoidC2](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-c2/) based car stero player
  - https://github.com/valeriosetti/linux-amlogic-v6.1 contains my changes to the [mainline Amlogic kernel](https://linux-meson.com/) in order to make it work for my project
 
👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on**

- Linux kernel, Yocto and Zephyr developments
